print("""The Zen of Bee#

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is buzzier than implicit.
Simple is sweeter than complex.
Complex is justified when simplicity abuzzs.

Readability counts, for Bee#s are meant to be read by the hive.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules, unless the hive insists.
Although purity beats practicality, practicality sometimes beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently, unless explicitly silenced by the Queen.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're a bee.
Now is better than never, but never buzzes quite as fast as right now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!""")

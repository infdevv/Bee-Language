# Docs for Bee# 

This is a simple super-set of python, however its the first super-set to allow multi-language coding ( Python / JS ).

## How to use

- Super Variables:

A super variable is a variable that uses the hard-drive to store large amounts of data that the ram can't hold.

Usages:

svar(variable)
svar_read(variable)

- Multi-language:

This can run Javascript alongside Python.

Usages:

javascript_exec(code) # Basic Javascript running
js_transfer(code) # Kills the Bee#/Python process and moves to Javascript fully

- Other:

This language uses include and import for importing modules
This language also requires that no matter what, "end()" must be on the last line of the code.
doc.log() can be used to print
doc.error() can be used to throw an error

This language has syntax like JS ( Excluding indentation ) thus meaning you can use function cool(){ }
This lannguage uses "function" instead of "def"
